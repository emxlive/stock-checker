# *stock-checker*
Testing functionalities of Node &amp; Express. 
StockCheck is using Marketstack API to get the data and real-time updates of the stock market.

The app at the moment has only 11 markets and some of the most important stocks. You can find basic details about markets and stocks. 
The website is fully functional, but the API  doesn't work correctly all the times

***I am still working on this project. The API I used doesn't offer lists of the markets.  In the future I will use Alpha Vantage API as it offers more in depth data and has a built-in Search Endpoint.
This resolves my problem with the market list and it's afferent stocks.
Also it offers fundamental data of companies including company overviews from experts.***
## Features
* Simple Menu
* Search with Smart Autocomplete from jQuery UI depending on the market selected
* List of all the markets with future possibility to view all the stocks from it
* Stocks section that will use an algorithm to decide which stocks performed best from that day
* Stock prices and volume of the selected stock from the last 100 days
* Rushay Parikh
